# Road To Web3: Week 1 ðŸ¥³

### Tutorial Link: https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-develop-an-nft-smart-contract-erc721-with-alchemy
### Side Note: I didn't follow the tutorial exactly but I achieved the same outcome, I modified it to deploy on Polygon & used Hardhat instead of Remix.

### Used [Firebase](https://filebase.com/) for hosting my metadata on IPFS.

### Commands:
```
yarn compile
```
### Deploy to Polygon Mumbai testnet:
```
yarn deploy
```
### Output:
```
