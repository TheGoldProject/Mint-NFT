# Road To Web3: Week 1 ðŸ¥³

### Tutorial Link: https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-develop-an-nft-smart-contract-erc721-with-alchemy
### Side Note: I didn't follow the tutorial exactly but I achieved the same outcome, I modified it to deploy on Polygon & used Hardhat instead of Remix.

### Used [Filebase](https://filebase.com/) for hosting my metadata on IPFS.

* View the metadata in the `metadata1.json` file

### How did I mint?
    1. First, I used OpenZepplin's Smart Contract Wizard to create my ERC21 Smart Contract. [see here](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard)
    2. Then, I added code to only allow 1 mint per user. The total NFT supply is 10. 
    3. I deployed my contract to Mumbai & also verified my contract! Verifying my contract allows me to write to my contract directly from PolygonScan! 
    4. I then connected my wallet & called the `safeMint()` function with my address & the link to my metadata stored on IPFS
    5. You have to make sure your metadata meets OpenSea's metadata standards for it to be able to display it. [see here](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards)
       1. Address: `0x858C60547fE069724B017c8e42c4b27BE4F151C6`
       2. URI: `ipfs://QmbJ4tJAgTMuBLUheCYZezjHSKnUwyBYa9qN8xxRxYYXjM`
